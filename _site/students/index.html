      <h3 id="grad-school-admissions">Grad school admissions</h3>

<p>Thanks for your interest in working with me! I am broadly recruiting PhD students through Linguistics, Computer Science and the Center for Data Science. If you mention my name in the application in any of these departments, I will read your application.</p>

<p>The Linguistics department will be a better fit for you if you are interested in scientific questions about language and/or broader Cognitive Science. If you are primarily interested in NLP, I recommend applying to Computer Science or the Center for Data Science, depending on your curricular interests and maybe fit with other faculty in the respective departments.</p>

<p>Application links:</p>

<h3 id="recommendation-letters">Recommendation letters</h3>

<p>If you’ve worked with me in some capacity I’d be very happy to write you a recommendation letter. But for this I ask you to kindly do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Email me</strong>: Even if I verbally agreed to do it, please email me to get the confirmation on record.</li>
  <li><strong>Give me at least 3 weeks</strong>: If the earliest deadline that I have to meet is less than three weeks away, I won’t be able to write you a letter.</li>
  <li><strong>Share your application materials and deadlines</strong>: If I agree to write you a letter, share your application materials (that is, whatever you’re submitting to the opportunity you’re asking the letter for) and the deadline/list of deadlines with me. If it’s not graduate school application, send me the description of the opportunity/event as well. The earlier the better! The deadlines should be in the first email you send. The application materials can come a bit later, but not something like the day before the earliest deadline. I understand if the material is in draft stage, but often just a work-in-progress draft helps a lot with letter writing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apologies in advance that I will have to decline requests that don’t follow the above instructions, and thanks for understanding!</p>

<h3 id="research-opportunities-for-bu-students">Research opportunities for BU students</h3>

<p><strong>Undergrads</strong>: I typically ask undergraduate students to have taken &amp; performed well in at least one of my advanced computational courses (i.e., non-intro) before discussing research opportunities, unless you already have prior research experiences. Then, feel free to reach out to me to either: (1) pitch a project that is UROP-scoped that aligns with my research interests, or (2) ask if there are RA opportunities (but RA opps are sparse).</p>

<p><strong>MS students</strong>: I have limited availability for MS supervision. I might agree to collaborating in rare circumstances, but similarly to undergraduates I’ll typically only agree to work with students who have taken one of my non-intro classes.</p>

<p><strong>PhD students who are not my advisees</strong>: Reach out to me and we can discuss more!</p>
