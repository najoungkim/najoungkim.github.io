### Grad school admissions

Thanks for your interest in working with me! This cycle I will be recruiting students through the Linguistics Department at BU. If you mention my name in the application, I will read your application. Apply [here](https://ling.bu.edu/).

For students who are primarily interested in NLP: unless you have additional interest in Linguistics and/or broader Cognitive Science, the Linguistics program might not be the best fit for you. The CS or the Data Science programs might be better, but I will NOT be recruiting directly through these programs this year at BU. But if you are admitted through these programs, I'd be happy to chat about collaborating/mentoring (in non-advising capacities) when you're here.

### Recommendation letters

If you've worked with me in some capacity I'd be very happy to write you a recommendation letter. But for this I ask you to kindly do the following:

* **Email me**: Even if I verbally agreed to do it, please email me to get the confirmation on record.
* **Give me at least 3 weeks**: If the earliest deadline that I have to meet is less than three weeks away, I won't be able to write you a letter.
* **Share your application materials and deadlines**: If I agree to write you a letter, share your application materials (that is, whatever you're submitting to the opportunity you're asking the letter for) and the deadline/list of deadlines with me. If it's not graduate school application, send me the description of the opportunity/event as well. The earlier the better! The deadlines should be in the first email you send. The application materials can come a bit later, but not something like the day before the earliest deadline. I understand if the material is in draft stage, but often just a work-in-progress draft helps a lot with letter writing.

Apologies in advance that I will have to decline requests that don't follow the above instructions, and thanks for understanding!
