### Grad school admissions

Thanks for your interest in working with me! I am broadly recruiting PhD students through Linguistics, Computer Science and the Center for Data Science. If you mention my name in the application in any of these departments, I will read your application. 

The Linguistics department will be a better fit for you if you are interested in scientific questions about language and/or broader Cognitive Science. If you are primarily interested in NLP, I recommend applying to Computer Science or the Center for Data Science, depending on your curricular interests and maybe fit with other faculty in the respective departments.

Application links:

### Recommendation letters

If you've worked with me in some capacity I'd be very happy to write you a recommendation letter. But for this I ask you to kindly do the following:

* **Email me**: Even if I verbally agreed to do it, please email me to get the confirmation on record.
* **Give me at least 3 weeks**: If the earliest deadline that I have to meet is less than three weeks away, I won't be able to write you a letter.
* **Share your application materials and deadlines**: If I agree to write you a letter, share your application materials (that is, whatever you're submitting to the opportunity you're asking the letter for) and the deadline/list of deadlines with me. If it's not graduate school application, send me the description of the opportunity/event as well. The earlier the better! The deadlines should be in the first email you send. The application materials can come a bit later, but not something like the day before the earliest deadline. I understand if the material is in draft stage, but often just a work-in-progress draft helps a lot with letter writing.

Apologies in advance that I will have to decline requests that don't follow the above instructions, and thanks for understanding!

### Research opportunities for BU students

**Undergrads**: I typically ask undergraduate students to have taken & performed well in at least one of my advanced computational courses (i.e., non-intro) before discussing research opportunities, unless you already have prior research experiences. I try to agree to supervise undergraduate research very sparingly, but feel free to reach out if you do meet one of the criteria I mentioned.

**MS students**: I have limited availability for MS supervision. I might agree to collaborating in rare circumstances, but similarly to undergraduates I'll typically only agree to work with students who have taken one of my non-intro classes.

**PhD students who are not my advisees**: Reach out to me and we can discuss more!
