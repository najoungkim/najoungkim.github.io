I'm an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://ling.bu.edu/">Department of Linguistics</a> and an Affiliated Faculty at the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/">Department of Computer Science</a> at Boston University. I am also a Visiting Faculty Researcher at Google. Previously, I was a Faculty Fellow at the <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/">Center for Data Science</a> at New York University. Even before that, I was a PhD student in the <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/">Department of Cognitive Science</a> at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/psmo/">Paul Smolensky</a> and Dr. <a href="http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/rawlins/">Kyle Rawlins</a>. My interests, broadly, are meaning and generalization in human and machine learners. I use computational and experimental linguistic methodologies to explore these areas. Please refer to the <a href="/publications">Publications</a> section to find out more.

I have a new "<a href="/students">For students</a>" section for current and prospective students!
